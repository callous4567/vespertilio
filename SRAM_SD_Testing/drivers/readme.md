# This is just a quick note on these libraries
There are a few bits here which I did not write myself! These include...

- FatFs_SPI is drawn from no-os-FatFS, the popular library used on the Pico for handling SD cards and the like 
- bme280, which was mostly written in pico_examples (and why I chose to use the BME280! xD) 

Unless clearly stated it's probably written by me- I tend to be pretty obvious when I note that someone else wrote some code.
