# Batcorder, now named "vespertilio"

Aye- Latin for bat! Or bats- I have no clue. Witness as I chronicle all my efforts into making a Pi Pico-based bat recorder that tries to tap out the 500 kHz of the ADC on the Pico, paired with pressure-temperature-humidity sensing by the BME280! I plan to slap an external ADC on to get full 16-bit resolution, but that's beyond the point! :D
