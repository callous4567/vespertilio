# Here's the main case design that is currently running (as of PCB Ver. 4+) for the "internal case" that holds the PCB and batteries.
I've included some renders of the front and back. To mount the PCB to it, you just need some self-tapping M2 screws. To set up the battery compartment,
you'll need a soldering iron and the appropriate leaf spring battery clips from Keystone- check the BOM. Oh, and some wire that can handle at least 100 mA.
Some epoxy will help keep the battery clips in place- though it should not be necessary given I've included some indentations to avoid the clips coming loose 
(since they come with a fang to grab hold of 'em.) 

This is a WIP and all of this will be mentioned in the future guide I will write on how to build it/use it.
