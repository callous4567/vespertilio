# Here's the main case design that is currently running (as of PCB Ver. 4+) for the "internal case" that holds the PCB and batteries.
I've included some renders of the front and back. To mount the PCB to it, you just need some self-tapping M2 screws. To set up the battery compartment,
you'll need a soldering iron and the appropriate leaf spring battery clips from Keystone- check the BOM. Oh, and some wire that can handle at least 100 mA.
Some epoxy will help keep the battery clips in place- though it should not be necessary given I've included some indentations to avoid the clips coming loose 
(since they come with a fang to grab hold of 'em.) 

This is a WIP and all of this will be mentioned in the future guide I will write on how to build it/use it. For now though, for your viewing pleasure!

From the front, showing M2 screws alignment with the PCB going onto the case.

From the back, showing the battery compartment (without the clips put on yet.) You'll want to align the clips up so that the leaf-spring one
goes on the female and the flat no-spring one goes on the male. In any case, check the BOM.
