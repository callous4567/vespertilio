Quick design note about our cascaded op-amp.

On the primary digipot, the microphone is fed into P0A, 
the wiper is then fed into the inverting input of the primary,
P0B is connected to the output of the first stage of the cascade
as the feedback 

In this case, the gain is equal to -(P0B - W)/(W - P0A)

On the secondary digipot, output from the first stage is into P0A
the wiper to the inverting input of the second stage, 
P0B is connected to the output of the second stage of the cascade
as the feedback

In this case, the gain is equal to -(P0B - W)/(W - P0A)
