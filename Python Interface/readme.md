# This for the USB configuration of the device
At the moment, this is WIP. The .exe included does work- just follow readme.txt and you will be fine. 

## Planned configuration features
- Vary ADC sampling rate over sessions.
- Bootsel over USB instead of requiring use of the bootsel button on the pico. Should be easy to induce- Picoprobe does it over UART.
- GUI for the configurator- I want to make a real posh one!
